	<h3>About Second Opinion</h3>
	<p>Second Opinion was developed to assists patients with a sudden diagnosis who have been given risky or intense treatment recommendations 

	Patients with a sudden diagnosis who have been given risky or intense treatment recommendations often desire a second opinion before they make a medical decision.  There is also a growing market for online medical 2nd opinions.  How most of those sites work is like this: you upload your medical records and test results, you pay with your credit card, the business picks a doctor that it contracts with, sends them your info, and then that doctor writes back and gives you their opinion.  Insurance isn’t involved.  The problem with this is that (1) you don’t get to pick this doctor, (2) you have no idea if the doctor is a better doctor than the one you have already and (3) you don’t converse with this doctor and so if you have a complicated case you can’t verify they even read all your records correctly before they came to that conclusion.  The 2nd opinion you get, in other words, does not always provide the peace of mind you need.  Other options include asking your existing doctor for a reference, but they might send you to doctors in the same network, or people they know and agree with, etc. and so in that way you’re not getting what you want which is the possibility for a truly different idea.  You can also find people randomly on the internet or go with people your friends or family know. All this is not very scientific.</p>
